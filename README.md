# Aurebesh-Discord-JS-Bot
 A Javascript rewrite of my [Aurebesh discord bot](https://github.com/Raymond-exe/Aurebesh-DiscordBot), originally written in Java.

Click [here](https://github.com/Raymond-exe/Aurebesh-DiscordBot) to see the original bot made using [DV8FromTheWorld](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld)'s [Java-Discord API "JDA"](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

**To use:** Simply type `||ab (text)||` and send to a text channel that the bot is able to read. 
*Note: The bot **must** have permissions to manage messages in that channel, in order to delete the original message that was sent.*
